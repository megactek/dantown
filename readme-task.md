# Dantown Test - Maker-Checker System with Wallet Management

 ## Task Description:
 The objective was to build a maker-checker system using Laravel's MVC framework. This system allows users to create transactions that must be approved by a checker before execution. Approved transactions either credit or debit the user's wallet, while also updating the system pool balance. The following features were required:

 ## Features:
 1. Authentication: Implement authentication using Laravel's built-in system.
 2. Transaction Management:
    - Approved transactions adjust the system pool balance, acting as the third-party account.
    - Rejected transactions include notes for the user to review and possibly resubmit.
 3. Dashboard Management:
    - Each user has a wallet balance upon registration.
    - Approved transactions either credit or debit the user's wallet while debiting or crediting the system pool balance in a single database transaction.
 4. Review Process:
    - Transactions start with a "pending" status.
    - Only pending transactions can be reviewed.
    - Approved transactions are marked "approved" and executed without notes.
    - Rejected transactions are marked "rejected" with required notes.
    - Only rejected transactions can be updated.
    - Updated transactions revert to "pending" for re-review.
 5. Role management & access:
    - Makers can create transactions only.
    - Checkers can approve or reject transactions only.
    - `register` auth endpoint creates a user with role of `maker`.
    - `checker` endpoint creates a user with role of `checker`.
